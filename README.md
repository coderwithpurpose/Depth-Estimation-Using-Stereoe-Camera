# Depth-Estimation-Using-Stereoe-Camera 

making sense of the environemtn, and outputting robnot location relative to world view. 

hardware: 
- ZED Camera 
- Ground Vehicle 
- Jetson Xavier 


implementation: 
- rectify images recived from zed camera 
- detect unique features in the FoV 
- predict XYZ of feature to camera 
- calibrate cand correct readings by fusing scheme 
- produce XYZ in world view 


TO DO:
- upload video of implementation 
- how to run the system 
- encrypt missing files
